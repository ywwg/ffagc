Dear <%= @artist.name %>,

Congratulations, you have been awarded a <%= @year %> Firefly <%= @grant.name %>
Grant in the amount of $<%= @submission.granted_funding_dollars %> to help bring <%= @submission.name %> to this year's
Firefly Arts Festival <%= @year %>!

Thanks for your efforts -- the competition was fierce and there were a number of
really impressive projects to choose from this year!

Please visit your page on the Art Grant website and click the button to generate
a contract for your project.

If you are accepting the grant, please sign and return this contract to us ASAP,
and no later than end-of-day on <%= @values["contract_deadline"] %>. The signed contract
should be sent as an email attachment in a response (Reply All) to this email.
Scans are best, but high quality photographs are also acceptable in a pinch
(please, please, please have good, even lighting and framing if you must go
this route!).

If you are NOT accepting the grant, for whatever reason, please let us know ASAP
as well.

*If we do not hear from you, we will assume that you are NOT accepting the
grant, and we will allocate these funds towards something else!*

We are working hard this year to ensure prompt distribution of funds on a
predictable schedule. Your timely response helps ensure that this happens
for everyone!
